Exam 2018. Tic tac toe game 

## About
A good old three in a row game where one can choose to play against AI or in versus mode against another player.
The application code is pretty  messy and is still under developement , but is fully functional.

It includes the use of fragments (again not in a proper way),  firebase (noSql database), listView (highscore list)
