## About
A good old three in a row game where one can choose to play against an AI or in versus mode against another player (offline).
It includes the use of fragments, firebase (noSql database), listView (highscore list) and SQL Lite.    

## Requirements
Tools needed: 

-java sdk minimum 1.8

-android studio IDE

-emulator or an android phone (I used emulator Pixel 3a XL API 28 6", Pie)

-a firebase cloud account: https://firebase.google.com and replace token with your own.
tutorial:  https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup


## Install and run
First build the project and then just run theGame-app module using the play button. You may want to disable some actions against files in your antivirus program, if you have any, for faster build (for more details on this see: https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/studio-config?utm_source=android-studio#antivirus-impact).
